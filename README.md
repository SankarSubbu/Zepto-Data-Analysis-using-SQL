# Zepto-Data-Analysis-using-SQL

This is a complete data analysis project based on e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto - one of India's fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project shows real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis. 

## Project Overview
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:
- Understand customer purchase patterns
- Identify high-performing products and categories
- Analyze delivery trends and customer behavior
- Provide recommendations for improving user experience and retention

The Dataset is used from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset/data?select=zepto_v2.csv) and was originally scraped from Zeptoâ€™s official product listings. It mimics what youâ€™d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.
